# 🚀 POKEDEX PLUS - Showcasing Advanced CI/CD Integration!

> **🎯 This project demonstrates a sophisticated CI/CD pipeline that
> automatically synchronizes releases between GitHub and Docker Hub, ensuring
> perfect version consistency across platforms.**

## 🎭 The Main Feature: Seamless Release Synchronization

**Pokedex Plus** is more than just a full-stack application - it's a **CI/CD
showcase** that demonstrates how to build a production-ready pipeline with:

- **Automatic version management** using Semantic Release
- **GitHub releases** generated from conventional commits
- **Docker Hub synchronization** with the same version tags
- **Zero manual intervention** required for deployments

## 🚀 The CI/CD Pipeline: The Real Star of the Show

### 🎪 Semantic Release: Automated Version Management

Our project showcases **Semantic Release** as the core of our CI/CD strategy:

- **Commit Analysis**: Automatically analyzes commit messages to determine
  version bumps
- **Release Generation**: Creates GitHub releases with detailed changelogs
- **Docker Integration**: Automatically builds and pushes Docker images with
  matching version tags
- **Git Tagging**: Manages semantic versioning (major.minor.patch) based on
  commit types

```javascript
// release.config.js - The heart of our automation
const config = {
  branches: ["main"],
  plugins: [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    [
      "@semantic-release/git",
      {
        message:
          "chore(release): ${nextRelease.version} [skip ci]\n\n${nextRelease.notes}",
      },
    ],
    "@semantic-release/github",
  ],
}
```

### 🔄 How Our Pipeline Works (The Magic)

1. **Developer commits** following conventional commit standards
2. **Semantic Release triggers** on push to main branch
3. **Version analysis** determines if a new release is needed
4. **GitHub release** is automatically created with changelog
5. **Docker images** are built and tagged with the same version
6. **Docker Hub** receives the new images automatically

### 📝 Commit Standards (The Foundation)

Our pipeline relies on **Conventional Commits** to work properly:

```bash
# These commit types trigger different version bumps:
feat: add new feature (minor version bump)
fix: resolve bug (patch version bump)
BREAKING CHANGE: breaking change (major version bump)
docs: update documentation (no version bump)
style: code formatting (no version bump)
refactor: code refactoring (no version bump)
test: add tests (no version bump)
chore: maintenance tasks (no version bump)
```

## 🐳 Docker Integration: Seamless Container Management

### 🎪 Backend Container

```dockerfile
FROM node:22.18.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### 🎨 Frontend Container

```dockerfile
FROM node:22.18.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### 🎭 Docker Compose: Orchestration

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    image: eugiovannicruz/pokedex-plus-backend:latest
    container_name: backend
    environment:
      - PORT=${PORT}
      - MONGO_URI=${MONGO_URI}
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    networks:
      - app-network

  frontend:
    image: eugiovannicruz/pokedex-plus-frontend:latest
    container_name: frontend
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    networks:
      - app-network

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
```

## 🚀 How to Experience This CI/CD Magic

### 🐳 Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Clone and run the complete stack
git clone https://github.com/cruzgiovanni/pokedex-plus.git
cd pokedex-plus
docker-compose up -d

# Access the synchronized application:
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend: http://localhost:5000
```

### 🛠️ Local Development

```bash
# Backend development
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Frontend development (in another terminal)
cd frontend/pokedex-plus
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🎭 Technologies Powering This Pipeline

- **Node.js 22.18.0** - Modern runtime environment
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Next.js** - React framework with SSR
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database
- **Docker** - Containerization platform
- **Semantic Release** - Automated version management
- **Conventional Commits** - Standardized commit format

## 🚀 The Result: Perfect Release Synchronization

### 🎪 What Happens Automatically

1. **Every commit** to main branch is analyzed
2. **Version bump** is determined by commit type
3. **GitHub release** is created with changelog
4. **Docker images** are built with matching tags
5. **Docker Hub** receives synchronized releases
6. **Deployment** can use exact version tags

### 🐳 Docker Hub Integration

```bash
# Our pipeline automatically handles these commands:
docker build -t eugiovannicruz/pokedex-plus-backend:v1.2.3 ./backend
docker build -t eugiovannicruz/pokedex-plus-frontend:v1.2.3 ./frontend/pokedex-plus
docker push eugiovannicruz/pokedex-plus-backend:v1.2.3
docker push eugiovannicruz/pokedex-plus-frontend:v1.2.3
```

**The beauty**: These exact same version tags (`v1.2.3`) appear simultaneously
on both GitHub and Docker Hub, ensuring perfect synchronization.
